# Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects that I have developed while learning Computer Science.

## Projects

Each directory in the repository represents a separate project. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **1PStickGame**: A javascript and html program that runs a simple stick game with a PvP or PvC mode.
2. **Agario**: A remake of the Agario game using javascript canvas and a from scatch game engine with a math focus to teach different number bases
3. **AirHockey**: A javascript canvas game also using a game engine to emulate air hockey with circle vector collision
4. **EconomicMachineLearning**: A python based linear regression learning model designed to predict the housing affordability index given user submitted economic factors. Designed for Hack for the Homeless (2nd Place)
5. **Mastermind** A java recreation of the game Mastermind that stores game results in json files providing data for the computer to use for different game difficulties
6. **TypingGame** A typing game using a javascript canvas that experiments with importing jpeg and mp3 files into the game using a game engine
7. **ExtendedEssay** The python code I used to model a version of Shor's algorithm for non-quantum computers and test the efficiency on a classical computer
8. **CS_IA** My working folder as I begin developing my internal assessment project for HL IB Computer Science
9. **Math_IA** My folder that holds all the python code I wrote and data I compiled for my HL IB Math Internal Assessment. This code computes a least squares regression to fit equations to a set of data points read from text files in the folder


## Installation and Setup

Each project has its own set of dependencies and setup instructions, please reach out to me using the email below if you have any questions about how to run any of these projects
