# Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects that I have developed while learning Computer Science.

## Projects

Each directory in the repository represents a separate project. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **1PStickGame**: A javascript and html program that runs a simple stick game with a PvP or PvC mode.
2. **Agario**: A remake of the Agario game using javascript canvas and a from scatch game engine with a math focus to teach different number bases
3. **AirHockey**: A javascript canvas game also using a game engine to emulate air hockey with circle vector collision
4. **EconomicMachineLearning**: A python based linear regression learning model designed to predict the housing affordability index given user submitted economic factors. Designed for Hack for the Homeless (2nd Place)
5. **Mastermind** A java recreation of the game Mastermind that stores game results in json files providing data for the computer to use for different game difficulties
6. **TypingGame** A typing game using a javascript canvas that experiments with importing jpeg and mp3 files into the game using a game engine
7. **ExtendedEssay** The python code I used to model a version of Shor's algorithm for non-quantum computers and test the efficiency on a classical computer
8. **CS_IA** My working folder as I begin developing my internal assessment project for HL IB Computer Science
