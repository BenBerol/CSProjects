# Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects that I have developed
## Projects

Each directory in the repository represents a separate project. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **Climbing Biomechanics Pipeline** A climbing biomechanics analysis pipeline that overlays motion-tracking data on climbing videos to study climbing technique, body positioning, and efficiency. ([Link to pipeline in use](https://youtu.be/EXuvL7wGgsc))
2. **Math_IA** The code for my HL IB Math Internal Assessment. This code computes a least squares regression to fit equations to a set of data points read from text files in the folder
3. **AirHockey**: A javascript canvas game that uses a homemade game engine to emulate air hockey with circle vector collision
4. **ExtendedEssay** The python code I used to model a version of Shor's algorithm for non-quantum computers and test the efficiency on a classical computer
5. **Mastermind** A java recreation of the game Mastermind that stores game results in json files providing data for the computer to use for different game difficulties. The computer learns off of previous games to determine easy versus hard starting setups
6. **EconomicMachineLearning**: A python based linear regression learning model designed to predict the housing affordability index given user submitted economic factors. Designed for Hack for the Homeless (2nd Place)
7. **CS_IA** An interactive model of the behavior of a swerve drive robot using a physics simulation that computes the rotation and velocity of each wheel alongside a visualization of the motion

## Installation and Setup

Each project has its own set of dependencies and setup instructions, please reach out to me using the email below if you have any questions about how to run any of these projects

## Contributing

While this project is primarily for my personal educational purposes, I'm open to suggestions and contributions. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
