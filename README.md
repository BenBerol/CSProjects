# Computer Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of various projects that I have developed while learning Computer Science.

## Projects

Each directory in the repository represents a separate project. Here's a brief overview of each:

1. **1PStickGame**: A javascript and html program that runs a simple stick game with a PvP or PvC mode.
2. **Agario**: A remake of the Agario game using javascript canvas and a from scatch game engine with a math focus to teach different number bases

5. **Mastermind** A java recreation of the game Mastermind that stores game results in json files providing data for the computer to use for different game difficulties
6. **TypingGame** A typing game using a javascript canvas that experiments with importing jpeg and mp3 files into the game using a game engine


## Installation and Setup

Each project has its own set of dependencies and setup instructions, which can usually be found in the respective project directory.
